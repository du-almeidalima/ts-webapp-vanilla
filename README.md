# JS/TS WebApp Vanilla

This project is just a self challenge to build an component oriented WebApp. Since I like the Angular approach of modularizing the assets I tried to replicate that. In order to achieve the importation of static assets with vanilla JavaScript I used WebPack with the file-loader plugin, and to bundle everything up the html-webpack-plugin. <br>
Also I used TypeScript since it makes the code more secure and easier to detect bugs upfront, the goal of this little project was to build a WebApp that is scalable using vanilla JS.
